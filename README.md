It's an online travel web site for lodging reservations & other travel products,we can search for all the available hotels by name or by type or by price , every hotel has his own photos where the owner puts the best pictures of his hotel .
first i buit a restful api (crud) i can add or remove or edit or get hotels or users or rooms with node js and mongo db . then i built the front-end section with react js and i fetch my data with axios , my website does not have a alot of data or real data i create some hotels just for testing .
